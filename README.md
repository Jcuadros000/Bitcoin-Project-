Our project, named **Bitcoin Tracker**, focused on creating a real-time cryptocurrency monitoring system by applying principles from ECE 425. This system was engineered to monitor live Bitcoin prices independently, without the need for a smartphone or computer, thus providing users with a dedicated hardware solution. The anticipated output featured a real-time display of Bitcoin prices on an LCD, along with alert mechanisms utilizing an RGB LED and a buzzer to notify users when predefined price thresholds were breached.

To implement this, we employed two microcontrollers: the TM4C123GH6PM from Texas Instruments, which managed the display, alert, and user interface functions, and the ESP32 module, responsible for connecting to the internet to retrieve real-time Bitcoin price data through a public API. Communication between the microcontrollers was facilitated via UART serial communication, allowing for data parsing and display on a 16x2 LCD screen. User interaction was enabled through a push-button, while the LED and buzzer provided immediate alerts for price drops below the specified thresholds.

The system incorporated various embedded peripherals, including **GPIO** for controlling the LED, buzzer, LCD, and button; SysTick for managing timing delays; and UART1 for receiving data from the ESP32. Additional components included a potentiometer for adjusting LCD contrast and a custom-designed 3D-printed enclosure to house the system. Development and debugging were conducted using **Keil ÂµVision**, and thorough testing was performed to ensure accurate data parsing and system responsiveness.

In summary, the Bitcoin Tracker effectively illustrated fundamental embedded systems concepts through a practical application. It highlighted the seamless integration of Wi-Fi-enabled data retrieval with local microcontroller processing, resulting in an accessible and user-friendly product that fulfilled its design objectives.
